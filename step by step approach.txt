tep 1: Choose a JavaScript Framework
Select a JavaScript framework like React, Angular, or Vue to build the user interface.
Consider using React for its popularity, ease of use, and vast ecosystem of libraries.
Step 2: Design the JSON Data Structure
Design a JSON structure to store all categories and subcategories.
Ensure it supports nested subcategories for a hierarchical structure.
Step 3: Set Up Your Project
Create a new project directory.
Set up your chosen JavaScript framework (e.g., create-react-app for React).
Step 4: Build Components
Create reusable components for categories, subcategories, and expandable dropdowns.
Implement hover and click event handlers for categories and subcategories.
Use typeahead search functionality to facilitate easy searching within categories and subcategories.
Step 5: Utilize CSS Framework
Choose a CSS framework that fits the material design aesthetic.
Integrate the CSS framework into your project and use its components for styling.
Ensure smooth animations and transitions to enhance user experience.
Step 6: Implement Expandable List
Depending on user preference, implement either a vertically expandable dropdown list or an expandable sidebar list.
Ensure categories and subcategories expand smoothly on hover, revealing nested items if present.
Prioritize built-in UI components from the chosen framework to streamline development.
Step 7: Architectural Considerations
Design an architecture that allows the addition of new categories or subcategories without modifying the code.
Use a flexible data structure and modular components to accommodate future changes.
Step 8: Testing and Optimization
Test your application thoroughly to ensure all features work as expected.
Optimize performance by minimizing unnecessary renders and optimizing data fetching.
Step 9: Documentation and Deployment
Document your code, including how to run the project locally and any dependencies.
Deploy your application to a hosting platform for public access.
Step 10: Review and Iterate
Gather feedback from users and stakeholders.
Iterate on your design and implementation based on feedback to improve usability and functionality.
